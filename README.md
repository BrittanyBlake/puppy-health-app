<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a Health and habits tracking app for pets built with React/Redux and Ruby on Rails. The App comprises of a list of categories such as food, walks, appointments. When the user selects a category, they are taken to the tracking page which shows a list of all of the entries. From there, the user can either add more entries or take a closer look at the details of that entry. All of the data in this application is retrieved from and posted to my custom [Puppy Health RESTful API](https://github.com/BrittanyBlake/puppy-health-api) and is retrieved through the redux store.
